# Smart Contracts

This folder contains the source code of the smart contracts deployed to the Tezos blockchain.

## Taqueria

The project uses [Taqueria](https://taqueria.io). It allows to easily compile, deploy and interact with the smart contracts. It also provides an automation to run [Flextesa](https://taqueria.io/docs/plugins/plugin-flextesa/) with defined wallets and initial balances.
